Rational basis of the non-lover’s proposal

The speaker claims his relationship (“affairs”) benefits both parties equally.

He argues that love is unnecessary for mutual advantage and that affection can exist without passion.

Stability and reliability of the non-lover

Lovers regret the benefits they once gave when their passion fades.

Non-lovers act by free choice and reason, not compulsion, managing relationships as prudently as they do their own affairs.

Non-lovers do not measure or resent what they give; they act willingly and consistently.

Freedom from emotional imbalance

Lovers justify neglect of family or duties through their obsession, but non-lovers remain composed and reasonable.

Once freed from passion, lovers lose their former beliefs and become unreliable.

Thus, love is a kind of “sickness” or mental affliction that no wise person would wish to “cure.”

Wider range of choice and better matches

The pool of non-lovers is much larger, offering greater chances to find someone truly compatible and worthy of friendship.

Public reputation and discretion

Lovers brag about their affairs and attract public gossip, while non-lovers act with restraint and self-control.

Society inevitably notices lovers’ behaviors, while friendships between non-lovers are viewed as respectable and unproblematic.

Jealousy and possessiveness

Lovers are insecure and suspicious, fearing rivals and isolating their beloved from others.

This breeds conflict and loss of friendships.

Non-lovers, being rational and virtuous, feel no jealousy and promote harmony and mutual respect.

Physical vs. moral affection

Lovers often desire the body before knowing the character; once desire fades, the relationship dissolves.

Non-lovers form friendship first, which endures even after pleasures are shared, serving as a foundation for lasting affection.

Moral improvement through friendship

Being loved by a rational, self-controlled person makes one better.

Lovers, blinded by passion, flatter excessively, lose judgment, and praise trivial things.

Non-lovers, governed by reason, are balanced, patient, and forgiving—traits that sustain long friendships.

True friendship vs. erotic dependence

Strong bonds like those between family members or faithful friends exist without erotic love.

Therefore, lasting affection does not require passion but mutual respect and shared virtue.

Benefiting those who deserve or need it

Two possible principles of generosity are explored:

(a) Helping those most in need, who will be most grateful.

(b) Helping those capable of reciprocating loyalty and benefits.

In both cases, non-lovers are better recipients and givers of favors than unstable lovers.

Social and moral decorum

Non-lovers value discretion and long-term loyalty over boasting and fleeting passion.

They remain constant even after beauty fades, showing genuine friendship instead of opportunism.

Conclusion

Non-lovers are never blamed for poor judgment due to passion, unlike lovers.

The speaker doesn’t advocate granting favors to all non-lovers indiscriminately, only to worthy ones.

Such relationships produce mutual benefit and no harm.

















Socrates start separating the desire and pleasure with the reasoning and moderation, then he grants the word love the meaning of a passion based on irrational and immoderate desire of beauty.



Madness in not necessarily bad, not a cause of shame or blame


The origin is imperishable. The origin cannot be generated as it would imply that is not the origin anymore. If the origin has been destroyed then all things that depend on it would be destroyed and then the world would collapse. This origin (THE SOUL) moves itself and generates all motion, is the thing that moves or body.

Is like their arje must still act, and if we are moving is because something began the movement, so our movement is dependant of that arje, in our case what moves us is this principle too that we will denominate soul 



The soul that just descended from the heavens is firstly planted on someone who is a lover of wisdom, with the argument that cannot change that drastically from the heavens to a animal.
The second generation in a king rule/abiding, a militar. The third in a political an, an estate manager or a money-maker. The fourth a doctor, someone who loves toil or a gymnastic. The fifth in a priest or someone mystical, six a poet or imitation man, seven farmer or craftsman, eight sophist or demagogue, ninth a tyrant. Who lives justly have a better portion. each soul’s future fate depends on whether it lives justly or unjustly during its earthly life.

It takes each soul 10,000 years to return to the same spot whence 
she started

Souls lose their wings and fall to earth because of forgetfulness and wrongdoing (kakia).

Life on Earth:
The soul lives a human life.

Judgment after death:

Good souls → go to heaven for reward.

Bad souls → go underground for correction.

After 1,000 years:
All souls meet at a place to choose their next life.

If the soul remembers truth (the Forms) → reborn as human.

If not → reborn as an animal.

Full cycle = 10,000 years
Most souls take this long to return to the divine realm and regrow their wings.

Philosophers are special:
The true lover of wisdom can regain wings after 3,000 years (three good lives in a row).



Talking about love, when a bad soul lost in unnatural pleasures experience beauty for the first time in the beauty of a boy, he eagers it and gives all for staying as close as it as posible, as she (the soul) has experience true beauty for the first time after she lost the memory. 



Plato describes love (eros) as a kind of divine madness that arises when the soul recognizes beauty on earth and remembers the true Beauty it once beheld among the gods. This memory causes both pain and joy — the soul “grows wings” again, striving to ascend toward the divine.

Every soul once followed a god (Zeus, Ares, Apollo, etc.), and when a lover finds a beloved whose soul resembles that god, he worships and tries to guide him toward virtue and divine likeness. True love is thus spiritual and aims at moral and intellectual growth, not merely physical desire.

Plato illustrates this through the chariot allegory:

The charioteer represents reason.

The noble horse symbolizes disciplined impulses guided by honor.

The bad horse represents base passions and lust.

When the soul sees beauty in the beloved, the good horse obeys reason, but the bad horse pulls toward physical pleasure. After internal struggle, if reason prevails, the lover and beloved live a virtuous, harmonious life, helping each other grow wings again and approach the divine.

If passion wins, they may yield to bodily desire, but even then, their bond remains strong and affectionate, though less pure. In both cases, love elevates the soul — but only the philosophical, self-controlled love leads to true blessedness and ascent to heaven.



They switch to the art of rethoric, what they think is that rhetoric without truth is nothing and someone who knows the truth but nothing of rhetoric cannot express it. 

A key thing in rhetoric is playing with the words that their meaning is not completely sure, words like love which meaning can be different for different person helps the sophist to use the same argument for being in one position and on the contrary 



A bronze maiden I am; on Midas’ remains I lie. 
So long as rain falls and mighty oaks grow, 
Stationed here by this much-lamented tomb, 
I announce to travelers-by that Midas is buried here. funny order 




Socrates distinguishes real rhetoric from what sophists like Lysias or Thrasymachos teach: the handbooks only give the prerequisites, not the true art. Students must figure out the full method themselves.

True rhetorical skill requires both natural talent and study and practice; without natural ability, one cannot reach perfection.

Socrates praises Pericles as the model of a perfect rhetorician: he combined innate talent with the philosophical understanding of nature (learned from Anaxagoras) to master the art of speech.

Rhetoric is compared to medicine: just as a doctor must understand the nature of the body to heal, a rhetorician must understand the nature of the soul to persuade and cultivate virtue.

Understanding the whole—body or soul—is essential; partial knowledge is insufficient for true art.


The art of the rhetoric is focused persuade the soul of the one who is hearing it, therefore, if someone wants to master the rhetoric he has to comprehend first the soul.

Theuth presenta sus inventos a Thamus, entre ellos la escritura.

Theuth afirma que la escritura hará a los egipcios más sabios y mejorará su memoria.

Thamus, sin embargo, corrige al dios y le dice que su invención producirá el efecto contrario:

No aumentará la sabiduría, sino la apariencia de sabiduría.

No fortalecerá la memoria, sino el olvido, porque la gente confiará en los signos escritos y no en su propio pensamiento.

“No has inventado un remedio para la memoria, sino para el recuerdo (anamnesis).
 

Until someone knows the truth about each of the things he speaks 
or writes about and is able to define everything according to itself and, 
having defined it, knows how to cut it up again according to its forms 
until it has come to the state where it can be cut up no more; and until 
that person sees thoroughly into the nature of the soul according to 
these same principles, discovering the form that most fits each nature, 
and accordingly makes and arranges his speech, supplying intricate 
or multi-colored speeches, covering all the harmonic modes for an in- 
tricate or multi-colored soul and supplying simple speech for a simple 
soul
