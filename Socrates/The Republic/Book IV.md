Book IV is where Socrates and his friends (Glaucon, Adeimantus) **complete the construction of the just city** begun in Books II–III, and then use that model to **discover the nature of justice in the individual soul.**

The key project is:

> To find what justice (and injustice) are, first in the city, then in the soul.

---

**Epistemic Method:**  
The city is a **larger, more visible analogy** (368d–369a): it’s easier to “read” justice on the large scale first, then apply that understanding to the smaller, internal case.  
Socrates doesn’t claim the two are identical, but that they are **isomorphic** — structured in the same relational pattern.
The derivation is not arbitrary; it’s based on the assumption that **political order is an externalization of psychological order**.
## **1. The City’s Structure Is Complete**

At the start of Book IV, the basic framework of the _kallipolis_ (“beautiful city”) is already set up:

- **Three classes:**
    
    1. **Rulers** (philosophers or guardians proper)
        
    2. **Auxiliaries** (soldiers or defenders)
        
    3. **Producers** (farmers, craftsmen, merchants)
        

The discussion in Book IV begins by addressing **Adeimantus’s objection**:  
If the guardians have no private wealth, property, or families, won’t they be unhappy?

---

## **2. Socrates Defends the Guardians’ Happiness**

Socrates replies:

- The goal is **not to make one class especially happy**, but to make the **whole city happy and harmonious**.
    
- A city is like a body — one part shouldn’t thrive at the expense of the others.
    
- Each class contributes to the good of the whole; if the rulers do their job, all will benefit.
    

Thus, **collective happiness** (the city’s good) takes precedence over **individual pleasure**.

He also adds:

- Guardians will be happier in a deeper way: they’ll have unity, friendship, and freedom from greed.

## **3. The City’s Virtues: Wisdom, Courage, Moderation, Justice**

Now that the city’s structure is stable, Socrates looks for its **four cardinal virtues**.  
This is the crucial part of the argument.

### (a) **Wisdom**

- Found in the **rulers**.
    
- It is the **knowledge of what is beneficial for the whole city** — political wisdom.
    

### (b) **Courage**

- Found in the **auxiliaries**.
    
- Defined as **the power to preserve through everything the correct belief about what is to be feared and what is not** — true opinion about danger, as taught by the rulers.
    

### (c) **Moderation (Sophrosyne)**

- A harmony between all classes — agreement about **who should rule and who should obey**.
    
- It’s not restricted to one class, but pervades the entire city.
    

At this point, three virtues are located. The city is **wise, courageous, and moderate**.

---

## **4. Discovering Justice in the City**

Now, what’s left — the “residue” — must be **justice**.

They reason:

> If we remove wisdom, courage, and moderation, whatever remains in the city that makes it good and well-ordered must be justice.

They identify it as:

> **Each class doing its own work and not meddling in the work of others.**

So justice = **everyone minding their proper business.**

- Rulers rule,
    
- Auxiliaries defend,
    
- Producers produce,
    
- None interfere with the others’ roles.
    

This principle (“one person, one job”) was present from the beginning (Book II), but now it’s **recognized as the essence of justice**.

- A good city is one in which the parts perform their proper functions harmoniously.
    
- Wisdom, courage, and moderation describe specific excellences _within_ that harmony.
    
- The principle that establishes and preserves that harmony is justice.
    
- Therefore, justice is not an additional part, but the **ordering relation** among all parts.

---

## **5. Parallel in the Individual Soul**

Having found justice in the city, Socrates now applies the **analogy between city and soul**:

> The city is large; the soul is small, but structured in the same way.

He argues that the **individual soul has three parts** corresponding to the three classes of the city.

### (a) **Rational part (reason)**

- Loves truth and wisdom; aims to rule.
    

### (b) **Spirited part (thumos)**

- Source of courage, indignation, ambition.
    
- Ally of reason when properly trained.
    

### (c) **Appetitive part (desire)**

- Craves food, drink, sex, money — bodily pleasures.
    

He supports this tripartite division with examples:

- A thirsty person who refuses to drink (because it’s bad for him) shows **reason** and **desire** are distinct.
    
- Anger can oppose appetite but side with reason — showing a third part (**spirit**) between them.
    
## **1. The Spirited Part (Thumos) and Its Relation to Courage**

In Book IV of _The Republic_ (especially 439e–441a), Socrates introduces **spirit (thumos)** as a distinct element of the soul, intermediate between reason and appetite.  
He discovers it through psychological observation:

- When we feel **anger** or **indignation** against our own desires — for instance, when we resist temptation and feel “angry at ourselves” — it shows that there is a part of the soul that can **side with reason against appetite**.
    
- Yet this spirited element is not itself rational; it doesn’t deliberate about the good, but **acts as an emotional ally of reason** when properly trained.
    

So spirit is the **seat of moral emotion** — pride, indignation, the drive for honor, shame, and self-respect.  
It is what gives the soul its **energy for action** and its **resistance to injustice**, both within and without.

Courage is therefore the **virtue proper to the spirited part**.  
Just as the auxiliaries in the city preserve the rulers’ correct belief about what should and shouldn’t be feared, spirit in the individual preserves reason’s judgment about what is truly dangerous and what is not.

---

## **6. The Soul’s Virtues Mirror the City’s**

Just as in the city, each part of the soul has its own virtue:

|**Virtue**|**Where found**|**Definition**|
|---|---|---|
|Wisdom|Rational part|Knowledge of what’s best for the soul|
|Courage|Spirited part|Preserving reason’s command about fear and danger|
|Moderation|Whole soul|Agreement among parts that reason should rule|
|Justice|Whole soul|Each part doing its own work and not meddling|

Thus:

> **Justice in the individual** = psychic harmony, where reason rules, spirit supports it, and appetite obeys.

---

## **7. The Nature of Injustice**

By contrast, **injustice** is:

> When any part of the soul oversteps its function — e.g., when appetite or spirit tries to rule.

So injustice is **inner disorder**, **civil war in the soul**, just as injustice in the city is class conflict or usurpation.

---

## **8. Conclusion: Why Justice Is Good in Itself**

Socrates concludes:

- Justice is like **health of the soul**; injustice is **disease**.
    
- A just person lives in inner harmony, regardless of wealth or reputation.
    
- Therefore, justice is desirable **for its own sake**, not just for external rewards.
