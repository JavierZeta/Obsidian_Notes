## **1. Transition from Book I**

Book I ended with Socrates apparently refuting Thrasymachus’ claim that _justice is the advantage of the stronger_.  
However, Glaucon and Adeimantus are not convinced.  
They believe Thrasymachus’ position still expresses what most people _really_ think — that injustice is naturally more profitable, and justice is practiced only out of compulsion.  
So they _revive_ the argument, demanding a more thorough answer from Socrates.

## **2. Glaucon’s Challenge (357a–362c)**

Glaucon divides his speech into three parts:

1. **A classification of goods**
    
2. **The common view of justice as a social contract**
    
3. **The story of Gyges’ Ring** as proof that people are just only when compelled.
    

---

### **(a) Three kinds of goods**

Glaucon asks Socrates to define justice as a kind of _good_.  
He divides goods into three classes:

1. **Intrinsic goods** — desirable _in themselves_, like joy or harmless pleasure.
    
2. **Mixed goods** — desirable _both in themselves and for their results_, like health, knowledge, sight.
    
3. **Instrumental goods** — not desirable in themselves, but only for their _consequences_, like medicine, exercise, or money-making.
    

Socrates says justice belongs to the **second class** — good in itself _and_ for its results.  
Glaucon insists most people see it as belonging to the **third class** — _only good for its rewards_.

→ **Challenge:** Socrates must show that justice is good in itself, apart from any reputation or reward.

---

### **(b) The origin of justice (the social contract theory)**

Glaucon reconstructs the _conventional_ story of how justice arose:

- **By nature**, every person desires to do wrong — to take more than others, to exploit, to dominate — and to avoid suffering wrong.
    
- The experience of _being wronged_ is worse than the pleasure of _doing wrong_.
    
- Therefore, people _agree by convention_ to abstain from both — forming laws and covenants for mutual protection.
    
- Justice, therefore, is a **compromise**, not a natural good.
    
- It lies **between** the best (doing injustice freely) and the worst (suffering it helplessly).
    

Hence, justice is **accepted reluctantly**, not because it is loved but because people are too weak to do injustice safely.

→ **Justice = social contract born of weakness.**

---

### **(c) The Ring of Gyges (359c–360d)**

To show that people are only just when constrained, Glaucon tells a myth:

- Gyges, a shepherd in Lydia, finds a **magical ring** that makes him invisible.
    
- Once he discovers its power, he seduces the queen, murders the king, and seizes the throne.
    
- Since no one could see or punish him, he committed every injustice with impunity.
    

→ **Lesson:** If anyone could act unjustly without fear of detection or punishment, everyone would do so.  
Justice is thus _only practiced out of necessity_, not conviction.

Glaucon extends this thought experiment:

- Imagine two men: one completely **just**, but thought **unjust**; and one completely **unjust**, but thought **just**.
    
- The unjust man gains wealth, power, and honor — all the rewards of seeming just.
    
- The just man suffers poverty, shame, and torture — all the penalties of seeming unjust.
    

→ Only if the just man is shown to be happier _even under these conditions_ can Socrates prove that justice is good _in itself_.

---

## **3. Adeimantus’ Supplementary Challenge (362d–367e)**

Adeimantus strengthens Glaucon’s argument by examining the **moral education** and **religious teachings** that surround justice.

---

### **(a) How justice is taught**

- From childhood, people are told to be just _for the sake of the rewards_:
    
    - Good reputation, honors, wealth, noble marriages, divine favor.
        
- Likewise, injustice is condemned _because of its consequences_: disgrace, punishment, divine wrath.
    
- No one praises justice _for itself_, for what it does to the soul.
    

→ Society corrupts our understanding: justice seems _useful_, not _good_.

---

### **(b) Poets and religion reinforce the wrong idea**

- **Poets (Homer, Hesiod)** depict gods rewarding justice with wealth and long life, and punishing injustice with ruin.
    
- **Priests and prophets** promise rituals and sacrifices that can _wash away sins_ and bring divine favor, even to the unjust — for a fee.
    
- Thus, even the gods are portrayed as **bribable**.
    

→ Moral implication: injustice, with cunning and hypocrisy, may secure both worldly success and divine pardon.

---

### **(c) The corruption of the soul**

Given such teachings:

- Young people reason that being just in appearance, while practicing injustice secretly, is the _best strategy_.
    
- They see injustice as _profitable_ and justice as _naïve_.
    
- Therefore, anyone who truly loves justice for itself seems foolish.
    

→ Adeimantus demands that Socrates **praise justice itself**, not for rewards in this life or the next, but for its intrinsic nature and its effects on the soul.

---

### **(d) Summary of the Challenge**

- Socrates must show that **justice itself** makes the soul better, and **injustice** corrupts it.
    
- He must separate _the essence_ of justice from _its reputation_ and consequences.
    
- Only then will they know whether the just man is truly happier than the unjust one.
    

---

## **4. Socrates’ Initial Response (367e–369b)**

Socrates praises Glaucon and Adeimantus for reviving justice from neglect — calling them “divine brothers.”  
He agrees to defend justice itself, but proposes a **method**:

- Since justice in a single person may be hard to discern, let’s first look for it in a **city**, where it appears larger and clearer.
    
- Once we understand what justice is in a city, we can apply the same definition to the **individual soul**.
    

→ This begins the _analogy between city and soul_ that dominates the rest of the _Republic_.

---

## **5. The Origin of the City (369b–372e)**

To find justice, Socrates constructs the city from its origins.

### **(a) The root cause: human need**

- A city arises because no one is self-sufficient; we depend on others to meet our needs.
    
- Therefore, people gather and divide labor according to natural aptitudes.
    

### **(b) The first, simple city ("city of pigs")**

- The minimal city contains only basic trades: farmers, builders, weavers, shoemakers, etc.
    
- Everyone contributes what they are best suited for; thus, there is natural division of labor.
    
- The result is a healthy, peaceful, modest life — simple food, plain houses, no luxury.
    
- Glaucon interrupts, mocking this as a “city fit for pigs.”
    

---

## **6. The Luxurious City (372e–374e)**

To satisfy Glaucon, Socrates adds luxury:

- Now the city includes cooks, painters, musicians, barbers, actors, and servants.
    
- These luxuries create _new needs_ — for territory, trade, and defense.
    
- The city will thus need **soldiers or guardians** to protect it and manage wars that arise from expansion.
    

→ This introduces the **guardian class**, whose nature and education will occupy the next parts of the _Republic_.

---

## **7. The Qualities of the Guardians (374e–376c)**

- Guardians must be strong and brave, yet gentle to their own people.
    
- They must possess a nature that is both **spirited** (for courage) and **philosophical** (for self-control).
    
- Therefore, they require a special **education**, balancing physical training (gymnastic) and musical/literary training — the beginning of the _education of the soul_.

Socrates compares the guardians’ nature to that of a **well-bred dog**. Just as a good dog is gentle to those it knows and fierce to strangers even if the one who they know treated him bad and the stranger didn't treat him in any manner. The guardian must unite **spirit and reason**: spirited enough to defend the city, yet intelligent enough to discern friend from foe. This combination shows that the guardian’s soul must be both **philosophic and courageous** — loving knowledge and truth as the dog loves and recognizes its master. Without philosophy, spirit becomes savagery; without spirit, philosophy becomes weakness. The true guardian, therefore, mirrors the noble dog’s balance of gentleness and strength.

He loves knowledge/He loves the known. Socrates makes a mistake here. 

→ At this point, Socrates will proceed (in Book III) to shape the _curriculum_ of the guardians and the _moral fictions_ that sustain the city.
