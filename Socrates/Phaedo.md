 "What a strange thing,
 my friends, that seems to be which men call
 pleasure !
 How wonderfully it is related to that
 which seems to be its opposite, pain, in that they
 will not both come to a man at the same time, and
 yet if he pursues the one and captures it, 
he is
 generally obliged to take the other also, as if the
 two were joined together in one head." 

So the first phrase of socrates is related with the correlation between pain and pleasure. and then mocks aesop for creating god stories about this type of philosophical reasoning

People shouldn't kill themselves cause we are chattels of gods and they don't want to lose them before they ordered to. This beliefs that even if gods possess us we have the power to decide. 



Arguments of socrates

Philosophers are always talking about nothing but death so in fact they should be eager to die. 

As he believes that death is the separation of soul and body, then, cause philosophers don't seek pleasures, they seek knowledge there shouldnt be a problem with the lost of the body.

Body cannot attain the real knowledge only deceive us.  


Sense are not helping to gain pure knowledge, that's why body is usesless, instead the reason seems to have a higher dimension for socrates higher than the physical body.

So because we cannot abandon or body until god says we need to live the most unattained live to the body as possible until we die and reach this death with happiness.

Cebes express the idea of the destruction of the soul after death.

Cebes also introduce the idea of the creation of the living beings through the death ones, as he explains that the warm before was cold to be called warm and same with countless oposites so 
then the live need to come from the death. 

Socrates replies with the idea of that in the same manner as the death comes frome a living being, the live must come from something in the death so our soul exists there. 

Another argument they give for backing up the rebirth is that everything we know we are not learning it but remember it that why with enough help someone can give the correct answer, it seems like what we call reasoning they call it remembering 

Now the world of ideas comes haha, they said that we must have some knowledge before being born because we know some concepts as equality, the perfect equality and we compare the objects of our reality to that perfect equality and same for other concepts as justice. 

This knowledge is gain before being born because most of the human beings cannot attain in their lifes, they lack of intelligence, nevertheless, their souls had intelligence before and was on the birth that they lost the knowledge, thats why we are just remembering,
concept of cycle here.

The compounded is liable to be decomposed and change, the uncompounded is not liable to change, so the perfect,abstract,uncomppunded and permanent. ideas like beauty(worst example)



 I mean, for example, that those who have
 indulged in gluttony and violence and drunkenness,
 and have taken no pains to avoid them, are likely
 to pass into the bodies of asses and other beasts of
 that sort. Do you not think so ?  budismo total

The soul cannot be the harmony that is formed after the body like the harmony of a lyre when its perfectly made with cords and wood, because the sould doesn't follow the body like the harmony of the lyre does, the soul oppose to the body in countless situations. Also the harmony must be perfect always and we know that there are better and worse souls if we accept that the soul is the only ruler of the actions of the body/human.

I think i dont get this part, but he says that as soul is life and opposites can't come close to each other, the soul must be inmortal. And when death comes soul is already gone. so there must be something inmortal in us living beings and this one is the soul.
