The sense give us information about the particular only, but is the wisdom what gives as the general knowledge.

Because wisdom can explain why of the things and sense can only tell this is what it is.

The knowledge of things that not useful started when men started to have leisure



The more universal a knowledge is the most difficult are for men to know as they are more far away from senses


"And the most exact of the sciences are those which deal most with first principles; for those which involve fewer principles are more exact than those which involve additional principles, e.g.  arithmetic than geometry"

The lover of wisdom is who doesn't seek it for any utilitarian end, therefore lovers of myth are in a sense a lover of wisdom too.

Wisdom is then a divine science, because God is the principle of all things and the cause of everything. This science is beyond any end, therefore is not human(we are servants and dependent), is something more.
